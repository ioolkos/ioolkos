## My Missions

My mission is the technology and knowledge transfer from the Telecom space to Industrial Communication.
To do that, I leverage the BEAM virtual machine, as well as the programming language Erlang/OTP, developed at Ericsson AB.
My other mission is to make Open Source work as a sustainable model for industrial software components.

We need to build the future, my friends. Get in touch
